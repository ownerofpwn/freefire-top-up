### Notes:
- **Images**: Replace `hero-bg.jpg` with an actual image file for the hero section background.
- **Responsive Design**: For a real-world application, you should add media queries to make the site responsive on various devices.
- **Backend Integration**: The example above is static and doesnâ€™t include real payment integration or server-side logic. You would need a backend system to handle transactions securely.
- **Security**: When handling payments and user data, ensure to follow security best practices and comply with relevant regulations.

This template is just a starting point. You may want to enhance it further with additional features and a more polished design based on your needs.<br>
